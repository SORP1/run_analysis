## Dowload Raw Data

The raw data for this project is accelerometer data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and is provided at the links below:

Codebook: "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"

1. load "dplyr" package

## Unzip files

1. Unzip files.
There will be a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" and it includes 5 types of files and 2 folders:

files: 
- x: rows of feature measurements
- y: the activity labels corresponding to each row of X. Encoded as numbers.
- subject: the subjects on which each row of X was measured. Encoded as numbers
- features.txt
- activity_lables.txt

folders:
- test: the actual dataset for the test phase
- train: the actual dataset for the train phase

## Process Data

1. Read each file into tables using <read.table()> and assign them a name

2. Assign column names "activity" to "y" files & "subject" to "subject" files

3. Replace the encoded numbers in "y" file with activities within the "activity_labels.txt" file

4. Cbind 2 datasets, the first one cbinding all "train"" datasets and the second one all "test" datasets

5. Rbind the datasets created in point 4

6. Subset the data for the columns including "mean" & "std" by using the "grapl()" function and store it as "tidy_ds". This will be the first tidy dataset

7. Using dplyr's "group_by" function, group the dataframe "tidy_ds" by "activity" and take the means of all columns using the "summarize()". Store the new dataframe as "mean_activity". This will be the second dataset

## Write the new datasets as .txt files

1. Write the first .txt file using the "tidy_ds" dataframe using the "write.table()" function.
2. Write the first .txt file using the "mean_activity" dataframe using the "write.table()" function.

## Output files

There will be 2 output files:

1. "tidy_ds.txt"
2. "mean_activity.txt"
